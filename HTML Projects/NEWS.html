While the attacking batter would've been jubilant to get the team's captaincy in T20Is, he was also dropped from the ODI squad, with the selectors and new head coach Gautam Gambhir making their stance clear.

Hence, the 360-degree batter was snubbed for a spot in the Indian team for the ODIs in the island nation.</p>
