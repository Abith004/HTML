<p>Billionaire Elon Musk took a swipe at Microsoft and posted a laughing emoji on a meme as a major disruption in the tech giant's cloud services led to widespread flight delays across the globe and impacted several businesses and banks. In one post, Musk retweeted a cryptic tweet from 2021 in which he compared the tech giant to a fictitious business called "Macrohard". "Macrohard >> Microsoft. In another tweet, he posted a laughing emoji to a meme. The post, which accompanied a meme, noted that despite everything else crashing, X was still functioning."</p>
